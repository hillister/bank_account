        <p class="chooseUsHeading">Why choose us?</p>
        <p class="reason">- We can't promise financial expertise, but we can promise cute pig icons!</p>
        <p class="reason">- We won't judge your spending habits... unless you're buying bacon.</p>
        <p class="reason">- Our security? Well, let's just say it's as tight as a piggy bank with no opening!</p>
        <p class="reason">- Want interest? We prefer to keep things interesting, like hiding your money... for safekeeping, of course!</p>
        <p class="reason">- We're not greedy—just <em>very</em> enthusiastic about coins.</p>
